# ITS Hackathon - Ctrl Alt Elite
Finished 2nd place out of 13 teams in the 24 hour [RMIT ITS hackathon](https://sites.rmit.edu.au/itshackathon/) 

We had to develop and pitch an idea that tackles the theme of the event "flipped perspectives" (students teaching students)

Link to our [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://michaeldao.github.io/ITS-Hackathon-Live-Lecture/src/home.html
) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gvt8Gsoks) 

To enable websockets for the live chat feature, go to the directory (src/ws-chat-server) and type:
- npm install
- node index.js
